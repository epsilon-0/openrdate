============================================================
=== OLD CHANGELOG, by David Snyder <dasnyderx@yahoo.com> ===
============================================================

20081121 - Updated the arc4random.c to the latest OpenBSD version.
Modified the configure and arc4random to use the urandom dev instead of
the sysctl since this is being deprecated in linux kernels >= 2.6.19.

20071111 - Updated the arc4random.c file and the rdate.8 manpage to the
latest OpenBSD version. Also, rejiggered the makefiles just 'cause I
could.

20061002 - Updated the arc4random.c file to the latest OpenBSD version.

20060928 - Ok, I've gotten around to restructuring the source directory
structure. I know it's a bit of an overkill for such a small project, I
wanted to try it.

20060918 - Finally updated the package to the latest OpenBSD rdate
version. I know I should have done it sooner, but, you know, things pile
up. The primary difference is that ntp.c has been set to handle ntp
responses with ALARM status.

20050211 - First packaging and deployment of openrdate.  Added
configuration and makefile files. Defined a SA_LEN macro in ntp.c.
Added an inclusion of config.h and changed an #ifdef in rdate.c
